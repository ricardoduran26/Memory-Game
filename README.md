## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## How to play
This is a memory game with a 4 x 4 board. To win the game the player must match 8 pairs of cards. 

Once the page loads the timer begins. Each turn adds to the number of turns, after every 10 turns the star rating drops by one until there is only 1 star left.

When the player wins, a modal appears that tells them how long it took them to complete the game and how many stars they have.

To restart the game, the player must click on the restart button. This will shuffle the cards and reset the time and stars.
