# Memory Game Project

## Instructions

To play the Memory Game, clone this repo and open the index.html file on your local browser.

## How to play
This is a memory game with a 4 x 4 board. To win the game the player must match 8 pairs of cards. 

Once the page loads the timer begins. Each turn adds to the number of turns, after every 10 turns the star rating drops by one until there is only 1 star left.

When the player wins, a modal appears that tells them how long it took them to complete the game and how many stars they have.

To restart the game, the player must click on the restart button. This will shuffle the cards and reset the time and stars.
